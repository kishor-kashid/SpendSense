# Frontend Rules

## Component Structure
- Components in `frontend/src/components/` organized by feature:
  - `common/` - Reusable components (Button, Card, Loading, Modal)
  - `user/` - User-facing components (Dashboard, ConsentPrompt, etc.)
  - `operator/` - Operator-facing components (OperatorDashboard, etc.)
- Pages in `frontend/src/pages/` (Login, UserPortal, OperatorPortal)

## Authentication Pattern
- **Simplified demo mode** - No passwords or JWT tokens
- Role selection (Customer/Operator) + user dropdown
- AuthContext for role and user state
- UserContext for current user data
- localStorage persistence for session
- ProtectedRoute component for access control

## State Management
- React Context API (AuthContext, UserContext)
- Custom hooks: `useAuth`, `useConsent`, `useRecommendations`
- API service: `frontend/src/services/api.js` for backend communication

## Styling
- Global styles in `frontend/src/styles/globals.css`
- Component-specific CSS files when needed
- Responsive design required
- Clean, modern UI with good UX practices

## API Integration
- Use axios for HTTP requests
- Centralized API service in `frontend/src/services/api.js`
- Handle loading states and errors
- Show user-friendly error messages

## Routing
- React Router for navigation
- Protected routes require authentication
- Role-based access control (customers vs operators)
- 404/NotFound page for invalid routes

## Current Status
- ✅ Frontend setup complete (React + Vite)
- ✅ PRs #20-26 Complete: All frontend components, pages, and routing implemented
- ✅ Spending Insights: Transaction viewing, category breakdown, analytics added
- ✅ Consent Toggle: Always-visible toggle for consent management
- ✅ Conditional Display: Content shown/hidden based on consent status
- ✅ Recommendation Approval Flow: Users see approved only, operators review pending
- Next: PRs #27-30 (Polish Phase) - Integration Testing, Documentation, Performance, Final Evaluation
